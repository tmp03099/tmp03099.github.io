                            <p>Rock Climbing is a sport I really wanted to try when I lived in Vietnam. 
                                Climbing is really fun and never boring. For indoor climbing, they set up and 
                                routes on the walls and change them every month. They have many routes with different level for you 
                                to challenges yourselft. For Outdoor, you challenges yourself at many different mountain or rock around the world.
                                There are so many skills to acquire to train your body and mind. It's perfect for explorer.
